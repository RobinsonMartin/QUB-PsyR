Great!\nIf you open R Studio for the first time, it will look like this:\n\n\n\nFig 1. RStudio interace when opening for the first time\n\n\nThe interface has three parts, the R console, the memory, and the utility and help area. Once you open your first R script (you can do do by clicking on “File”, selecting “New File”, and choosing “R Script”), a fourth (and probably the most important) appears in the top left, the script area (note; when you close all scripts, the script area will disappear again until a new script is opened).\n\n\n\nFig 2.

    "text": "The RStudio interface components\n\nThe console\nThe console is the direct link between RStudio and R. It executes the R code we enter, either manually or by running (part of) a script. With the exception of plots, the output of the code we entered, is also displayed in the console. We will be using the console mostly in the early states of getting used to working with R. We can execute code in the console by typing it in and confirming it via the “Enter” key. Doing so will directly produce the result of the code we entered (if we did it correctly) or an error message (if we managed to botch it up).\n\n\nThe memory\nThe memory area is one of the many advantages of using RStudio as compared to R only. It has different subsections. The subsection labeled Environment displays all the objects that are currently in R’s memory. Examples of such objects include variables we defined, data we read into R, or models we fit on our data. The list of objects in the Environment is rather handy because we do not need to memorize the names of all our objects, and we can even have a closer look at our more complex objects (e.g., we can have a look at the individual variables in our data object).\nThe second subsection is the History of our R session. The history contains all the code we sent to the console (irrespective of whether we did it by manually entering code in the console or by running a script). Using the History is handy if we want to trace back what we did, for example to search for errors.\n\n\nUtility and Help\nThe Utility and Help area located on the bottom right has five subsections, which can be tremendously helpful, so let’s have a closer look at them.\n\nFiles: This section displays the content of the current working directory. We can use it like the windows explorer to search for and load files.\nPlots: If we create plots, they will be displayed in this subsection.\nPackages: The base version of R comes with a wide range of functions that we can use to handle and analyse data. However, we will frequently want to do things that base R cannot do. In those situations, we will require additional R packages. The Packages section shows, which packages are installed on our computer, and which ones are currently active (more on that later).\nHelp: The Help section is very important. We can use it to obtain information on all functions and objects contained in base R and all currently active packages.\nViewer: We will rarely be using the Viewer when starting to learn R. It can be used to display local html-files that we can create using R.\n\n\n\nThe Script\nThe Script area in the top left of the interface is where we do most of our actual work. Here, we can create, save, load, and modify R scripts. If we open more than one script, each one will have its own tab displaying the name of the script (or labeling it as “unnamed” if we have not saved it yet). Clicking on the tabs lets us switch between scripts."

    "text": "Running code via R scripts\nThe most common way to run code in R is to write an R script and then execute it. The great advantage of an R script is that we can save it and re-run it as often as we want without having to enter everything by hand once again. If you are keen about Open Science, you can share the Script as part of your Open Analysis Code policy. Since R is free, researchers who want to look at, re-run, or even copy your code can do so without worrying about license fees.\nFor example, we can write a script containing the same computations we entered manually into the console above. To do so, we first need to create a new (end empty) R script by clicking on “File”, then on “New File” and selecting “R Script”.\n\n\n\nFig 2. Creating a new R script\n\n\nWe can now edit the script. Here, we enter each of the computations we want R to do as a single line of our script. Once all four lines are ready, we select them all (either by marking them with the mouse or by clicking ctrl+a). We then tell RStudio to run the selected code by clicking on the “Run”-button on the top right above the script or by pushing ctrl+Enter.\n\n\n\nFig 3. Running the code contained in the R script\n\n\nAs we can see, the output in the console looks as if we had manually entered the code and pressed “Enter” after each line. We could have obtained the same result by copy-pasting the content of the script into the console and hitting “Enter”.\nIn the image above, our script is yet unsaved as can be seen from its name “untitled1”. We can save it by clicking on the floppy disc Symbol (for those of you who still know what a 3.5” floppy disc is) or by clicking on “File” and then “Save” or “Save as”. Since we have not yet named our script, we will be prompted to select a name and to choose in which folder we want to save the script.\nFor example, we can name this script “my first script”. Once we have done that, the tab above the script shows the name of the script (or the start of the name if we chose a long name) followed by “.R” indicating that this is an R file.\n Also note how the name of the script is now shown in black font as opposed to the red font it had prior to saving. Writing a script’s name in red font is RStudio’s way of telling you that this script has unsaved changes."

Whether you define objects using arrows or equal signs has no effect on what R does. It is simply a matter of preference.\n\nAs soon as we have defined an object (and assuming that we did everything correctly), our new object will appear in the Environment tab of RStudio’s Memory section (top right panel).\nWe will now cover the most important of the basic R objects, namely:\n\nsingle values\nvectors\nmatrices\n\n\nWe will later turn toward two of the more complex R objects that we are very likely to encounter frequently when working with R:\n\ndata frames\nlists"

Function arguments are pieces of information a function needs to know in order to perform its task (very rarely, a function may not need any argument to perform its task). The general syntax for calling a function looks like this:\n\nfunction_name(argument1, argument2, ...)\n\nThat is, we first write the function’s name, and then define all required arguments in parentheses. If we do that correctly, the function will perform its task. Depending on the function, we will see an output in the console.\nWe will be using two functions below:\n\nThe function c, which we will use to create vectors. The arguments the function c requires are the elements we want to combine into a vector.\nThe function matrix, which creates a matrix from a vector. This functions requires a vector, the number of rows and the number of columns as arguments.\n\n\nCore fact 1: Functions can have a lot of arguments, but it is not always necessary to specify all of them. Most functions have default values for some of their arguments. If we do not specify these arguments, R will just run the function as if we had entered the default value of the argument. If we do specify arguments with default values, we simply override the default.\n\n\nCore fact 2: It is impossible (for most people at least) to remember all functions and which arguments they require. Therefore, R contains a lifesaver in the form of a special function called help. The function help requires the name of a topic (including but not limited to functions) as its main argument. Calling help with the name of a function will show the documentation for that function in the Help tab of the Utility & Help section of RStudio’s interface (bottom right)."

We can define vectors using the function c with the function’s arguments being the values we want to combine into the respective vector. The syntax looks as follow:\n\nv1 = c(1,2,3)   # This line of code creates a double vector \n                # called \"v1\" containing the numbers 1 to 3.\n\nv2 = c('hello', 'purple', '11!')  # This creates a character vector\n                                  # called \"v2\" containing three strings.\n\nAfter executing this code, our Environment contains two more objects, v1 and v2. The vector v1 is denoted as a numeric vector (num) whereas v2 is labeled as a character vector (chr).\nJust as with the single value a, we can have a look at our vectors by entering their names as code. For example, we can enter v2 as code.\n\n\n\n[1] \"hello\"  \"purple\" \"11!\"   \n\n\n\nWe now see the three character strings that v2 consists of in the console. Again, there is a [1] at the front of the line. It indicates that “hello” is the first element of v2. If the vector was long enough to occupy multiple rows in the console, each line would start with a number in brackets, indicating which element of the vector is displayed at the beginning of that line.\n\nFun fact: We can think of single values as vectors of length 1.\n\n\nCaveat: If we try to create a vector containing different types of elements, R will not complain (i.e., we do not get an error message)! Instead, R will simply transform some of the elements to ensure that all elements share the same type.\nFor example, if at least one of the elements we want to include in the vector is a character string, R will transform all other element types to character strings and create a character vector.\nIf we try to combine numeric (double or integer) and logical values into one vector, R will interpret “FALSE” as 0 and “TRUE” as 1."

In fact, matrices in R are vectors that we break down into rows and columns. To create a matrix, we need to call the function matrix and tell R three arguments: the vector we want to make into a matrix, the number of its rows, and the number of its columns. The syntax looks as follows:\n\nmatrix1 = matrix( # this tells R that we want to create a matrix\n  c(1,2,3,4),     # defines the vector that will turn into a matrix\n  nrow = 2,       # this tells R that our matrix should have 2 rows \n  ncol = 2)       # this tells R that our matrix should have 2 columns\n\nExecuting the code above creates a numerical matrix in our Environment.

The name “item2” is valid, but “2nd” is not (it will return a error message complaining about an “unexpected symbol”).\nObject names may not contain special characters with the exception of underscores and periods. For example, the names “item_2” or “item.2” are valid. Using other special character will often yield error messages because R interprets these characters as operators (e.g., “*” indicates multiplication, “&” is a logical conjunction, etc.).\nObject names must not contain spaces. While “item2” is a valid name, “item 2” is not.\n\n\nNot being allowed to use spaces in object names might prevent us from assigning meaningful and intelligible object names. To deal with the issue, there are three common types of notation:\n\nperiod notation: place periods where you would have placed a space, e.g. trial.number\nunderscore notation: replace spaces with underscores, e.g. trial_number\ncamelBack notation: instead of spaces write everything as one word, but write the beginning of new words with a capital letter, e.g. trialNumber\n\nWhich notation you use is purely a matter of preference.

    "section": "Data frames",
    "text": "Data frames\nData frames are R objects specifically designed for people who work with data. Just like matrices, they are two-dimensional objects. The main difference, however, is that data frames can contain different types of elements. To be exact, data frames are a combination of different vectors of the same length.\nThe general idea of a data frame is to view every row as an observation and every column as a variable. Therefore, each column represents a vector, which also means that, column-wise, all elements must be of the same type. The same is not true for the rows of a data frame.\n\nHow to define a data frame\nWe can define data frames by calling the function data.frame and entering vectors or matrices as function arguments. Here, vectors are treated as column vectors (or nx1 matrices, if you will). The only requirement is that all of the vectors and matrices we want to combine into a data.frame have the same number of rows.\nBelow is very simple example of how we can define a data frame in R. Imagine, we have collected data from 5 participants, which we will identify by the numbers from 1 to 5, and that we asked them to report their gender (open response) and age in years (numeric value).\n\nmy_data_frame = data.frame(\n  c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),                                       # participant ID\n  c('male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'female', 'female'),  # participant gender\n  c(25, 19, 23, 22, 28)                                   # participant age\n)\n\n\nNote: In this example, the code is distributed across several lines. Technically, we could have written it all in one long line, but doing so makes it very difficult to read the code. Unless we call a function with few or very short function arguments, it is recommended to use one line for each argument.\nAlso note how the function arguments are shifted a bit to the right. This is called indentation. Indentation has no effects on how the code works in R (it does in other programming languages such as Python!). However, it contributes greatly to the legibility of the code by structuring it.\nIt is, therefore, a good idea to get used to organizing longer pieces of code by using multiple lines and proper indentation. Your future self, your collaborators, and third parties, who will read your code when you make it publicly available, will thank you for it.\n\nOnce we execute the piece of code above, the data frame will appear as an object in RStudio’s Environment (top right). We can immediately see that it is a data frame because RStudio describes data frames as x observations of y variables. In our case that is listed as “5 obs. of 3 variables”.\n\nNote: The Environment will show a small light blue button with a white arrowhead to the left of our data frame’s name. If we click this button, RStudio will “unfold” the data frame and show us a list of the vectors it contains as well as the type of the vector.\n\nJust as with matrices, we can have a look at our new object by either entering its name or by clicking on it in the environment. If we do the former, R will return the data frame in the console, whereas the latter will open the data frame in a separate tab next to our scripts. Let’s go with the code version.\n\n\n\n  c.1..2..3..4..5. c..male....female....non.binary....female....female..\n1                1                                                  male\n2                2                                                female\n3                3                                            non-binary\n4                4                                                female\n5                5                                                female\n  c.25..19..23..22..28.\n1                    25\n2                    19\n3                    23\n4                    22\n5                    28\n\n\n\n\n\nAssigning proper variable names\nWe may notice two things: first, the data frame contains exactly the information we specified as function arguments for the data.frame function; second, each column of our data frame has a very weird name. The reason is that data frames require variable names for each column, and if we do not specify these names, R will just use each vector’s content as a name. This is inconvenient for a number of reasons, so it is desirable to assign proper names to the variables.\nOne way to do so is calling the function names, which allows us to change the names of a data frame’s variables. The function ‘names’ requires the name of the data frame as a function argument. We then define it as a character vector containing the new variable names. The character vector must contain one element for each column of the data frame. For our data frame, it could look like this:\n\nnames(my_data_frame) = c('ID', 'gender', 'age')\n\nIf we now ask R to show us the data frame in the console (by entering its name as code), it will look much tidier.\n\n\n\n  ID     gender age\n1  1       male  25\n2  2     female  19\n3  3 non-binary  23\n4  4     female  22\n5  5     female  28\n\n\n\nAnother way to assign sensible variable names is to specify them when creating the data frame. We can do so by making slight adjustments to the way we enter vectors as function arguments when calling the data.frame function. In fact, the code will look as if we define vectors as objects. The only difference is that when doing so within the data.frame function, the vectors will not be created outside the data frame (i.e., they will not appear as separate objects in the Environment). Here is what the code would look like for our data frame.\n\nmy_data_frame = data.frame(  \n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),                                          # ID\n  gender = c('male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'female', 'female'), # gender\n  age = c(25, 19, 23, 22, 28)                                     # age\n) \n\nThe result is the same as if we had used the names function.\n\n\n\n  ID     gender age\n1  1       male  25\n2  2     female  19\n3  3 non-binary  23\n4  4     female  22\n5  5     female  28\n\n\n\n\n\nEntering matrices into data frames\nAs mentioned above, we can also enter matrices as function arguments when creating a data frame, as long as these matrices have the correct number of rows. Let’s assume that we additionally collected responses from two Likert scale items (levels 1 to 5), which we would like to enter into our data frame. Our code would then look like this:\n\nmy_data_frame = data.frame(  \n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),                                          # ID\n  gender = c('male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'female', 'female'), # gender\n  age = c(25, 19, 23, 22, 28),                                    # age\n  matrix(c(1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2), nrow = 5)               # responses \n) \n\nRunning this code creates a data frame with 5 observations of 5 variables in in the environment. One problem is that we cannot name the two new variables contained in the matrix as we did with the vectors. However, when we look at our data frame, we will notice that the variable names do not look as terrible as they did when we entered the unnamed vectors. Instead, the variables will be named “X1” and “X2” (when entering a matrix, R will just assign the names from “X1” to “Xi” for a matrix with i columns).\nStill, we might prefer less obscure names for our two measures. One possibility is to use the names function as we did above. Another is to create the matrix as a separate object before creating the data frame. This allows us to set proper column names using the function colnames. This function works very similar to the names function but is specifically designed for matrices. Here is what the code would look like.\n\n# First, we create our 5x2 matrix as an object\nresponse_matrix = matrix(\n  c(1, 3, 5, 4, 3, 5, 5, 3, 2, 2), \n  nrow = 5\n)\n\n# Next, we assign column names\ncolnames(response_matrix) = c('item1', 'item2')\n\n# Finally, we create the data frame\nmy_data_frame = data.frame(  \n  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),                                          # ID\n  gender = c('male', 'female', 'non-binary', 'female', 'female'), # gender\n  age = c(25, 19, 23, 22, 28),                                    # age\n  response_matrix                                                 # responses \n) \n\nThe new variables in our data frame now have proper names. We can check this by calling the name of our data frame and inspecting it in the console (or by clicking on its name in the Environment).\n\n\n\n  ID     gender age item1 item2\n1  1       male  25     1     5\n2  2     female  19     3     5\n3  3 non-binary  23     5     3\n4  4     female  22     4     2\n5  5     female  28     3     2\n\n\n\n\nDefining objects outside a data frame and then simply using their name as a function argument when calling the data.frame function is not limited to matrices but can also be done for vectors. While there are good reasons for defining objects separately before combining them into a data frame, one downside is that our Environment can get a wee bit cluttered.\nIf we want to tidy up our environment, we can remove objects we no longer need (for example, because we put them into a data frame) using the function rm. We simply need to use the name of the object we want to remove as the function argument for rm, and it will be disappear from the Environment."

    "text": "Lists\nThe final type of R object we need to know for now is the list. Lists are very flexible containers that we can create using the list function. Think of lists as multi-purpose storage units. They can contain all other types of R objects (including other lists). For example, we could create a list that contains a single character string, a numeric vector, and a data frame. To do so, we simply call the function list and enter each object we want to store in the list as a function argument.\n\nmy_value = 'hello'          # a single character value\nmy_vector = c(1,1,2,3,5,8)  # a numeric vector\n\n# The following code creates a list with three elements\nmy_list = list(\n  my_value,\n  my_vector,\n  my_data_frame\n)\n\nrm(my_value, my_vector)   # this removes two of the objects from the environment\n\nAs with other objects, the new list will appear in the Environment. RStudio tells us that this object is a list of 3. Just like for a data frame, there is a small light blue button to its left that allows us to unfold the list and have a look at its contents.\nWe can also click on the list in the environment to have a look at it or have R print the list in the console by calling its name. If we do the latter, the output looks like this:\n\n\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n[[2]]\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n[[3]]\n  ID     gender age item1 item2\n1  1       male  25     1     5\n2  2     female  19     3     5\n3  3 non-binary  23     5     3\n4  4     female  22     4     2\n5  5     female  28     3     2\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the output lists the elements of our list one after another. The first element of the list is preceded by “[[1]]”, the second by “[[2]]”, and so on.\n\nNote: Once we start analysing data in R, we will frequently encounter lists. The reason is that many R functions used in inferential statistics use lists as outputs."

    "text": "Prelude - the $ operator\nBefore we delve into binary operators, we need to learn about a very useful operator specific to data frames and lists with named elements.\nThis operator is $. It is not a binary operator because it requires only one object.\nSpecifically, the $ operator allows us to extract a named element from a data frame or list.\nTo do so, we need two first write the name of the data frame (or list), immediately follow it with the $ operator, and then follow with the name of the element we want to obtain.\nHere is what the code looks like, generally speaking:\n\ndata_frame$variable_name\n\nHere is an example, in which we obtain a variable called age from a data frame called my_data_frame that, among others, contains this variable.\n\n# create a data frame\nmy_data_frame = data.frame(\n  ID = 1:5,\n  gender = c('m', 'f', 'f', 'nb', 'm'),\n  age = c(32, 66, 37, 41, 38)\n)\n\n# obtain age from the data frame\nmy_data_frame$age\n\nIf we run this code, R will display the information contained in the column labelled age in the console with the output looking as follows:\n\n\n\n[1] 32 66 37 41 38\n\n\n\nWe could also define the extracted column as a separate object and save it in the Environment.\nOne extremely useful feature in R is that we can use the $ operator to create new elements in a data frame or list. For example, we can add a new variable to the data frame from the previous example.\n\n# add a variable to the data frame coding whether \n# the participants is currently employed\nmy_data_frame$employed = c(T, T, F, T, T)\n\nOnce we run the code, R will update the data frame in the Environment. It will now be shown as “5 obs. of 4 variables” instead of the original “5 obs. of 3 variables”. Upon inspection, we can confirm that it now contains the new variable employed as its last column.\nHere is what the data frame would look like in the console:\n\n\n\n  ID gender age employed\n1  1      m  32     TRUE\n2  2      f  66     TRUE\n3  3      f  37    FALSE\n4  4     nb  41     TRUE\n5  5      m  38     TRUE"

    "section": "Back to binary operators",
    "text": "Back to binary operators\nBinary operators are symbols that R uses to represent a specific operation involving two objects. These operations can be arithmetic or logical. Before we jump into action, we need to have a look at how R’s binary operators look like.\n\nArithmetic binary operators\nR has seven built-in arithmetic binary operators (you will probably not use the last two, but we will include them for the sake of completeness).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nOperation\nWhat R does\n\n\n\n\n+\naddition\ncomputes the sum of two numbers\n\n\n-\nsubtraction\nsubtracts the second number from the first\n\n\n*\nmultiplication\ncomputes the product of two numbers\n\n\n/\ndivision\ndivides first number by the second\n\n\n^\npower\ntakes the first to the power of the second\n\n\n%%\nmodulo\ntakes the remainder of division\n\n\n%/%\ninteger division\ndivision rounded down to whole numbers\n\n\n\n\n\nLogical binary operators\nBesides arithmetic operators, R has several built-in logical binary operators. Logical binary operators also require two objects as arguments. They compare the object to the left of the operator to the object on its right and check if the result of this comparison is TRUE or FALSE. In other words, they return a Boolean value. Here is the list of logical operators:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperator\nWhat R tests\n\n\n\n\n<\nthe first value is less than the second\n\n\n<=\nthe first value is less than or equal to the second\n\n\n>\nthe first value is greater than the second\n\n\n>=\nthe first value is greater than or equal to the second\n\n\n==\nthe first value is exactly equal to the second\n\n\n!=\nthe first value is not equal to the second\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing binary operators on single values\nThe simplest way to use binary operators is to use them on single values. In the case of arithmetic operators, this comes down to adding, subtracting, multiplying etc. two numbers. As the two arguments for the operators, we can use values we defined as objects prior to the operation, values that we enter as is, or a combination of both. Here are a few examples.\n\na = \"hello\"   # a character value\nb = FALSE     # a Boolean value\nd = 13        # a numeric value\ne = 2         # another numeric value\n\na != \"hello\"  # tests if a is unqeual to the string \"hello\" (this is FALSE)\n\nb == FALSE    # tests if b is the Boolean value FALSE (which is TRUE)\n\nd + 3         # adds 3 to the object d (for a total of 10)\n\nd ^ e         # takes d to the power of e (the result is 169)\n\nThis is what appears in the console:\n\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n[1] 16\n\n\n[1] 169\n\n\n\n\nNote In the example above, we named the four objects a, b, d, and e. This was neither an oversight nor an expression of dislike toward the letter c. The simple reason is that there is a function called c, and it is prudent to avoid giving objects the same name as existing functions.\nTechnically, it is possible to assign an object the name of a function, but it may lead to confusion or problems with the R code. Therefore, it is best avoided.\n\nWe can create more complex operations by combining multiple arithmetic and/or logical operators involving multiple values, and we can save the result by defining it as another object.\n\nNote that R follows the basic rules of arithmetic operations. That is, power takes precedence over multiplication or division, which, in turn, take precedence over addition or subtraction. Just as in school maths, we need to use parentheses to organize our operations accordingly.\nWe can also use parentheses in the same fashion when combining multiple logical operations.\nWhen combining arithmetic and logical operators, the arithmetic operations take precedence over the logical ones.\n\nExample 1:\n\nx = 3   # define a numeric value\ny = 2   # define another value\n\nz = x ^ 2 / (x * y - x)\n\nIn the example above, we defined a numeric value called z. Since power takes precedence over division, R first computes x to the power of 2 (for a total of 9). It then divides 9 by the expression in the parentheses. Within the parentheses, multiplication takes precedence over subtraction, which means that R first computes the product of x and y (which is 6) and then subtracts x for a total of 3. So our code boils down to dividing 9 by 3. We can easily verify that R did that by inspecting the new object z.\n\nz\n\n\n\n\n[1] 3\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nx = 3      # define a numeric value\ny = 2      # define another value\nz = 'red'  # define a character value\n\nz != 'red' & (x > 2 | x + y == 7)\n\nIn this example, we test whether the two conditions combined by & (logical AND) are simultaneously TRUE. First, whether the value z equals the string ‘red’, and second, whether at least one of the following two statements combined with the | (logical OR) is TRUE: the value x is greater than 2 OR the sum of x and y equals 7.\nThe first statement is TRUE because z equals the character string ‘red’. The second statement is also true. While the sum of x and y clearly differs from 7 and is, thus, FALSE, x is greater than 2. Since the logical OR only requires one of the statements to be TRUE, the whole statement in parentheses is TRUE. Therefore, executing this code should return the Boolean TRUE, which we can check by inspecting the output in the console.\nIt looks as follows:\n\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\n\nIn theory, arithmetic operators should only work on numeric values (integer or double). Accordingly, R will complain if at lest one of the objects we use as arguments is a character string. Specifically, it will return an error message in the console stating that we assigned a non-numeric argument to the binary operator.\nSomething similar should happen if we assign at least one Boolean value, that is, a value stating either a logical TRUE or FALSE. Keep in mind, however, that R sometimes changes the type of an object so that it works with an operator or function (this is called coercion). If we use a Boolean value in an arithmetic operation, R will just treat it as a binary numeric variable (FALSE = 0, TRUE = 1).\n\n\n\nUsing binary operators on vectors and matrices\nWe can also use binary operators on vectors or matrices. The exact operation depends on the two objects involved. More specifically, if one of the two arguments of a binary operator is a vector or a matrix, then the operation differs depending on whether the second argument is a single vector or another vector or matrix.\nLets first look at the (simpler) case where one of the two arguments is a vector/matrix and the other is a single value. In this case, the exact same operation is performed on all elements of the vector or matrix. For example adding a single value and a vector/matrix means that the single value is added to each element of the vector/matrix, multiplying the vector/matrix by a number means that each element is multiplied by that number, testing whether a vector/matrix equals a certain character string tests for each element whether it equals that string, and so on. Let’s look at some examples.\n\nv1 = c('red', 'green', 'blue')  # defines a character vector\n\nm1 = matrix(1:9, nrow = 3)      # defines a numeric 3x3 matrix\n\na = 2         # defines a numeric value\n\nv1 == 'red'   # tests for each element of v1 whether it equals the string 'red'\n\na ^ m1        # takes a (the value 2) to the power of each element of m1\n\nm1 < 5        # tests for each element of m1 whether it is smaller than 5   \n\nThis is what appears in the console:\n\n\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2   16  128\n[2,]    4   32  256\n[3,]    8   64  512\n\n\n     [,1]  [,2]  [,3]\n[1,] TRUE  TRUE FALSE\n[2,] TRUE FALSE FALSE\n[3,] TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\nIrrespective of whether we enter the vector/matrix as the first or the second argument of the binary operator, the output has the same size and dimensions. That is, multiplying a vector of length 4 by a number yields a numeric vector of length 4. Multiplying a 3x3 matrix by a number yields another numeric 3x3 matrix. Testing whether a statement is true for a vector of length 7 returns a Boolean vector of length 7, and so on.\nWe can also use binary operators with both arguments being vectors or matrices. As a general rule, we must use objects of equal size in those operations, that is, if the object to the left of the operator is a vector of length 6, then the object to its right must also be a vector of length 6. Likewise, if we enter a 3x4 matrix to the left of the operator, our argument on its right will also have to be a 3x4 matrix.\n\nCaveat: While R complains when we enter two matrices of unequal size as arguments of a binary operator (it will print an error message in the console), the same is not true for vectors. If we sue binary operators on vectors of unequal length, R will simply extend the shorter vector by starting over.\nFor example, when adding a vector containing the numbers from 1 to 3 to another vector containing the numbers from 1 to 5, R will turn the first vector into a vector of length 5 by repeating the first two elements (the resulting vector then has the elements 1, 2, 3, 1, 2).\nThis built-in feature of R can cause problems because situations, in which we actually want to perform binary operations on vectors of unequal length, are rare. Since R will run the code without any complaints, we run the risk of missing bugs in our code. Therefore, it is prudent to double-check the code whenever we use binary operators with two vectors.\n\nWhen using binary operators with two vectors or matrices, R performs an element-wise operation. That means that R pairs the first element of the first vector or matrix with the corresponding element of the second vector or matrix when performing the operation. The second element of the first object is paired with second element of the second object, and so on. Let’s again look at a few examples.\nVectors first.\n\nv1 = c(2, 4, 6, 8)    # defines a numeric vector\n\nv2 = 1:4              # lazy way of creating a vector of length 4\n\nv1 + v2               # performs element-wise addition of the vectors\n\nv1 != v2              # takes each element of v1 abnd tests whether it is\n                      # different from the corresponding element of v2\n\nThis is what appears in the console:\n\n\n\n[1]  3  6  9 12\n\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\nNow for some matrices.\n\nm1 = matrix(c(2, 4, 6, 8), nrow = 2)    # defines a 2x2 matrix\n\nm2 = matrix(1:4, ncol = 2)              # defines another 2x2 matrix\n\nm1 - m2               # performs element-wise subtraction of the matrices\n\nm1 < m2               # takes each element of m1 tests whether it is less than \n                      # the corresponding element of m2   \n\nThis is what appears in the console:\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    3\n[2,]    2    4\n\n\n      [,1]  [,2]\n[1,] FALSE FALSE\n[2,] FALSE FALSE\n\n\n\nAs we can see, performing arithmetic operations on matrices using binary operators yields numeric matrices of the same size as the input matrices as result. When using logical binary operators instead, the result will be a Boolean matrix of equal size as the two input matrices.\n\nNote that using the binary operator for multiplication (*) on matrices does not do what we would expect from regular matrix algebra. If we want to do classic matrix multiplication, we need to use a special operator, namely %*%."

If we call this function and feed it the name of an R function as a function argument, R will display the documentation in the help tab of the utility & help section (bottom right of RStudio’s interface).\nNote that the function help will accept the function name both if we enter it as is or if we enter it as a character string (i.e., we write it in quotation marks).\nAs an alternative to calling the function’s name in regular R syntax, we can type the functions name in the search bar of the help tab.If we use this way to learn about a function, we do not need quotation marks.\nOnce we call the help function, R will show us the documentation of an existing R function or a group of related functions. R will generally display a lot of information. What information is displayed exactly depends on the function.\nThe following information will be shown for all functions:\n\nthe name of the function\nwhat R package it is from\na description of the the function does\nhow to call the function (usage)\nthe functions’ arguments\na description of the type and format of the function’s output (value)\nfunctioning R code showing examples of how the function can be used\n\nThere may be additional information for some functions such as: - a description of the maths or logic underlying the function (details) - additional information of potential interest to the user (note) - references to literature the literature the function is based on - links to related functions (see also)\nLet’s look at an example by asking R to show us the documentation for the function median using R syntax.\n\nhelp(median)\n\nR will now show us the following in the help tab.\n\n\n\nFig 1. Documentation for the function median\n\n\nLet’s first look at the description. Unsurprisingly, it states that this function computes the sample median.\nOne of most relevant sections of the documentation is the function’s usage. As we can see, the function median has two function arguments, x and na.rm. The second argument, na.rm has a default value, indicated by the equal sign and a specific value (FALSE) to its right. If we do not specify na.rm, R will use the value FALSE as a default. Since the argument x has no default, we must specify it. Otherwise, the function won’t run.\nThe other highly relevant section is the arguments section. It tells us what the function arguments do and values are acceptable for each of the two function arguments. The argument x must be a numeric vector (we can ignore the first part of the sentence referring quite obscurely to ‘an object for which a method has been defined’). This is the set of numbers for which we will compute the median. The second function argument, na.rm, defines how missing values (represented by NA, meaning “not available”) should be handled. The function will not work when our numeric vector x contains at least one NA value. By setting na.rm to TRUE, we can tell R to remove the NA values prior to computing the median.\nFinally, let’s inspect the value section. From what the function is supposed to do, we would expect it to return a single numeric value. The documentation tells us that this value can be a double type value when the vector is of even length (in this case, the median is the mean of the two centremost values of x). It also informs us that the output of the function will be NA if x is either an empty vector of if x contains NA values while na.rm is set to FALSE.\n\nAt the top left of the documentation, R states in braces following the function’s name which R package it stems from. In case of the function median, the package it belongs to is called stats. This package along with base is built into core R.\nCaveat: If a function does not belong to one of R’s built-in packages, R’s help will not know the function unless the respective package is loaded (see the section on installing and loading additional packages for more information)."

    "text": "Finding functions if their name is unknown\nSometimes, we might be looking for a function to perform a specific operation, but we do not know whether R has such a function and, if so, how it is called in R. In such situations, we can make use of the search bar on the top right of the help tab. If we input the term we are interested in there, R will return a list of related functions in the help tab.\nLet’s assume, for example, that we are looking for a function that computes the standard deviation of a numeric vector. Entering the term “standard deviation” in the search bar, yields the following output:\n\n\n\nFig 2. Search results for the term “standard deviation”\n\n\nAs we can see, R links to several help pages, each of which contains the documentation for a function that R thinks to relate to our search term. R displays the results of the search in a special format, namely package name::function name. For example, the first result of the search is the function devfun2 of the package lme4. Klicking on any of the links our search returned is equivalent to using the help function for the respective function.\n\nNote that unlike the regular help function, using the search bar is not restricted to currently loaded R packages. Any package that is installed on the computer will be included in the search. This handy feature is designed to maximize the chance of finding the function we are looking for.\n\nIn the example above, we can see that there is a function called sd in the stats package that is part of basic R. The brief description of this function looks promising enough to warrant klicking on the function’s name. The documentation for the function that R now displays confirms that this is the function we are looking for (see below).\n\n\n\nFig 3. Documentation for the function sd\n\n\nAs we can see from the documentations usage and arguments sections, the function sd requires a numeric vector x as a function argument. It has a second optional argument we are already familiar with, namely na.rm, which allows us to exclude NA values prior to computing the standard deviation.\nLet’s have a look at the details section of the function sd. This section contains an important piece of information, namely that the function uses the denominator \\(n-1\\). What this means is that the function sd computes an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation by multiplying the (uncorrected) sample variance by \\(\\frac{n}{n-1}\\) prior to taking its square root.\nAn alternative to using the search bar of the help tab is to use R code to search for functions. We can do so using a special operator ?? followed by the term we are searching for. If our term consists of more than one word, we need to put it in quotation marks (putting a single word in quotation marks won’t do any harm).\nThe syntax looks like this:\n\n??\"standard deviation\"\n\nWe can verify that searching for our term of interest using R syntax yields the same results in the help tab.\n\nCaveat: There is one situation in which using the search bar of the help tab and using the operator ?? will yield different results. If the search term matches the name of an R function, either from base R or from a currently loaded R package, the help tab will always display the documentation for that function instead of providing us with a list of potentially relevant functions. Using the ?? operator will always display the list of results.\n\n\nIf our search for the desired function is not successful, google (or any non-evil alternative search engine) is our friend. R has a very active and supportive community, and there are extensive resources for R users online."

    "section": "Combining several functions",
    "text": "Combining several functions\nWe will frequently find ourselves in situations, in which the operations we want to perform require calling not just one function but a sequence of functions.\nConsider, for example, a case, in which we want to create a list type object that contains descriptive statistics for two variables we observed. The first element of that list will contain the variables’ means while the second will contain their variance-covariance matrix.\nCreating the first element of that list is simple as it requires only computing the means whereas creating th 2x2 matrix requires computing the variances of the two variables as well as their covariance and then putting them in a matrix format.\nThe first way to go about this is to write R code such that we call each function separately and save its output as a new object. We then use this object as a function argument in the next function we need to call. Another possibility is to use a function call as the argument for the next function. Lets have a look at these two options.\n\nCalling functions separately.\n\nv1 = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)     # data for variable 1\nv2 = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)      # data for variable 2\n\n# compute means for v1 and v2 using the function 'mean'\nmean1 = mean(v1)\nmean2 = mean(v2) \n\n# create a vector of the means using the function 'c'\nmean_vector = c(mean1, mean2)\n\n# compute variances using the function 'var'\nvar1 = var(v1)\nvar2 = var(v2)   \n\n# compute the covariance using the function 'cov'\ncov12 = cov(v1, v2)\n\n# create the variance-covariance matrix using the\n# functions 'matrix' and 'c'\nvc_vector = c(var1, cov12, cov12, var2)\nvc_mat = matrix(vc_vector, nrow = 2)\n\n# now create the list using the function 'list'\nmy_list = list(means = mean_vector,\n               var_cov_matrix = vc_mat)\n\nWe can now have a look at the object we crated by calling the name of our newly defined list.\n\nmy_list\n\n\n\n\n$means\n[1] 7.142857 4.714286\n\n$var_cov_matrix\n         [,1]     [,2]\n[1,] 16.80952 17.04762\n[2,] 17.04762 19.57143\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the objects looks exactly as it should, and it contains the information we want it to contain. There is, however, a drawback to the piece-by-piece approach, we took in creating the list. It becomes apparent when we look at the Environment tab of the Memory section (top right).\n\n\n\nFig 1. Clogged Environment\n\n\nSince we defined the output of each function as an object of its own, our Environment contains not only the list we wanted to create, but also ten additional objects.Two of them are the original data, which we may want to keep, but the other eight objects are no longer required. Eight superfluous objects may not sound too much, but if we work on more complex tasks in R, the number of superfluous objects may increase rapidly.\nOne solution to solve the problem is to clean up afterwards using the function rm. This function takes an arbitrary number of R objects as function arguments. It removes all listed arguments from the Environment. Here is what the code looks like in our example.\n\nrm(mean1, mean2, mean_vector,\n   var1, var2, cov12,\n   vc_vector, vc_mat)\n\nAfter we run this code, the Environment looks much tidier. It now contains only the original data vectors v1 and v2 as well as the list containing the descriptive statistics.\n\n\n\nFig 2. Unclogged Environment\n\n\n\n\nCalling multiple functions in one go\nAn alternative to calling each function separately and defining interim objects is to use function calls as arguments for other functions. In theory, it is possible to write one(very long) line of code to create our list of descriptive statistics from the two data vectors v1 and v2. Here is what the code would look like.\n\nv1 = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13)     # data for variable 1\nv2 = c(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)      # data for variable 2\n\n# create the list using the function 'list'\nmy_list = list(\n  # create the first element of the list using the \n  # functions 'c' and 'mean'\n  means = c(mean(v1), mean(v2)),\n  \n  # create the second element using the functions \n  # 'matrix', 'c', 'var', and 'cov'\n  var_cov_matrix = matrix(\n    c(var(v1), cov(v1, v2), cov(v1, v2), var(v2)),\n    nrow = 2)\n)\n\nIn the example above, the R code is spread out between multiple lines for the purpose of better readability. We could have actually put it all into one line. If we now look at the Environment, we will only see the two original data vectors and the list we created. No interim objects were created, and there is not need to clean up afterwards.\nNote also how the code starts with the last step of the step-by-step approach. That is, if we use function calls as arguments for other functions, we need to think from the end to the start.\nOne downside of writing code containing convoluted function calls is that the code may become more difficult to parse for others or even for ourselves (especially if we revisit a script we wrote a while ago). For example, if we combine too many function calls, we may end up with a line of code that has a dozen closing brackets at its end. This is not only hard to read, but it may also lead to bugs in our code when we miss a closing bracket or include too many of them.\n\nNote: Either of the two ways of writing code shown above is viable. However, it is often advisable to choose a middle ground, where we define interim objects whenever the code would otherwise become to convoluted.\nAs always, readability of the code greatly benefits from making ample use of commenting."

    "text": "Most R objects consist of multiple elements, the exception being single values (or vectors of length 1 and 1x1 matrices, which technically are single values, too). There will be situations where we would like to view, extract, or change some, but not all elements of an object. For example we might want to remove the first four cases from a data set because they were test runs, or we might be interested in how the 22nd participant in our recent study responded to questions 13 and 14. What we do in those cases is tell R to look for specific elements of an object. That is called indexing.\nThe most generic form of indexing uses brackets. Specifically, we first write the name of the object of interest. In brackets following the object’s name, we define which elements we want R to obtain. We can obtain elements by their referring to their (numerical) position in an object or via logical operations (using either binary operators or functions).\nNumerical indexing means that we tell R in brackets which elements it should obtain by entering the elements’ position within the object. If the object is a vector, we need only provide a single number per element, wheres we need two coordinates in case our object is two-dimensional (e.g., a matrix or a data frame). Using numerical indexing, we can ask R to obtain a single element but also multiple elements of an R object.\nLets look at a few examples using vectors first."

    "text": "Numerical indexing of matrices and data frames\nLet’s now turn to two-dimensional objects. As mentioned above, we need to tell R the coordinates of the elements we want to obtain in the brackets following the object’s name. The coordinates must be separated by a comma, and we specify the rows before the columns (remember the roman-catholics as a mnemonic aid).\nFor the following examples, we fist generate a 4x4 matrix containing the numbers form 1 to 16.\n\nm1 = matrix(1:16, nrow = 4)  # create a numeric 4x4 matrix\n\nThe matrix looks as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s look at few examples of numerial indexing using our matrix m1.\n\n# extract the element in the 2nd row and the 3rd column (10)\nm1[2, 3]\n\n# extract the element in the 1st row and 3rd column (9) a well\n# as the element in the 4th row and 2nd column (8)\nm1[c(1, 3), c(4, 2)]\n\n# extract elements 1 to 3 in the 2nd row (2, 6, and 10)\nm1[2, 1:3]\n\nHere is what we will see in the console when running the code above.\n\n\n\n[1] 10\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]   13    5\n[2,]   15    7\n\n\n[1]  2  6 10\n\n\n\nA look at the console shows that R returns the desired elements as vectors. The reason is that we either asked for a single value (example 1), two elements from very different parts of the original matrix (example 2), or a vector of neighboring values within the original matrix (example 3).\nIt is possible, though, to obtain elements from a matrix so that R returns another matrix (of smaller size). The output will be another matrix if we extract elements from different rows but the same columns (or vice versa). Let’s have a look at a few examples below:\n\n# extract elements 1 to 3 in the 2nd row (2, 6, and 10)\n# and the 4th row (4, 8, 12)\nm1[c(2, 4), 1:3]\n\n# extract the 3rd and 4th elements of columns 1 (3, 4) \n# and 2 (7, 8)\nm1[3:4, 1:2]\n\nA look at the console confirms, again, that the code worked as intended.\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    6   10\n[2,]    4    8   12\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    3    7\n[2,]    4    8\n\n\n\nSometimes we might want to extract all elements of certain rows or columns of a two-dimensional R object. Theoretically, we could do so by entering all rows/columns in brackets, but R has an easier way for us to do that: stating nothing! Yes, you read that correctly. If we do not specify the rows or columns in brackets, R will understand that we want all of them. Since in those cases, the elements will either share their row or column positions, the resulting objects will be two-dimensional again (see examples below).\n\n# extract the complete 1st row (1, 5, 9, 13) and \n# 3rd row (3, 7, 11, 15)\nm1[c(1, 3), ]\n\n# extract the complete 3rd (9 to 12) and 4th column\n# (13 to 16)\nm1[, 3:4]\n\nHere is what R prints in the console:\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]    2    6   10\n[2,]    4    8   12\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    3    7\n[2,]    4    8\n\n\n\nFinally, as with vectors, we can use the operator - to tell R that we want all elements of a two-dimensional object except for some of them. For example, we could specify that we want to exclude some rows and some columns in brackets. Since we have two dimensions, we can also combine selection of certain rows with the exclusion of columns and vice versa. Here are a few examples.\n\n# remove the first row but obtain all columns \nm1[-1, ]\n\n# obtain rows 1:3, but remove columns 2 and 4\nm1[1:3, -c(2, 4)]\n\nThe output in the console looks like this:\n\n\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    2    6   10   14\n[2,]    3    7   11   15\n[3,]    4    8   12   16\n\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    9\n[2,]    2   10\n[3,]    3   11\n\n\n\nIn the examples above, we always obtained some elements of a matrix. However, the code would work in the same fashion, had the matrices been data frames instead. To show that this is true, lets look at a few examples using he data frame we created above.\n\n# obtain the element that is in the 3rd row\n# and the 2ns column of the data frame\nmy_df[3, 2]\n\n# obtain the first variable of the data frame\n# (yields the same output as my_df$ID would)\nmy_df[, 1]\n\n# obtain rows 2:4 of the data frame\nmy_df[2:4, ]\n\n# obtain all elements in rows 3 to 6 and\n# in all columns except for the first\nmy_df[3:6, -1]\n\nAs we can see from the output, two-dimensional indexing of data frames works as intended.\n\n\n\n[1] 32\n\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\n  ID age gender employment\n2  2  51      f       TRUE\n3  3  32     nb       TRUE\n4  4  23      f       TRUE\n\n\n  age gender employment\n3  32     nb       TRUE\n4  23      f       TRUE\n5  55      f       TRUE\n6  68      m      FALSE"

    "text": "Numerical indexing of lists\nFinally, we need to look at how numerical indexing works for lists. At first glance, lists seem to follow the same logic as vectors. They, too, are one-dimensional objects with a certain number of elements. However, indexing of lists uses a slightly different syntax. Specifically, we need to tell R which element or elements of a list we want to obtain using double brackets.\nLet’s first create a simple list to work with. Note how the last element of our list is another list (yes, you can put lists into list, that is how cool R lists are).\n\n# The following code creates a list with four elements\nl1 = list(\n  my_value = 'hello',               # a character value\n  \n  my_vector =  c(1,1,2,3,5,8),      # a numeric vector\n  \n  my_matrix = matrix(NA, nrow = 3,  # a 3x3 matrix of NAs\n                     ncol = 3),      \n  my_list = list(                   # a list of two objects\n    a = c('happy', 'hippo'),\n    b = 42\n  )\n)\n\nHere is what the new list looks like.\n\n\n\n$my_value\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n$my_vector\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n$my_matrix\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   NA   NA   NA\n[2,]   NA   NA   NA\n[3,]   NA   NA   NA\n\n$my_list\n$my_list$a\n[1] \"happy\" \"hippo\"\n\n$my_list$b\n[1] 42\n\n\n\nWe can now obtain elements of the list. However, lists are a bit more complicated than the other objects. In fact, there are two ways to obtain elements of a list. The first is using single brackets just as we did it with vectors. If we do that, R will return to us another list containing only the specified elements of the original list.\nIf we instead want to obtain a specific element of a list, we can index that element using double brackets instead of the single ones. Using double brackets will return the element in its original form. It will obtain values as value,s vectors as vector, matrices as matrices and so on. That is, R will not return a list when we use double brackets unless the element we are looking for is another list.\nLet’s look at a few examples using single brackets first (we will do them one by one because the output of a list in the console can be a bit longer).\nWe can obtain a single element.\n\n# obtain a list containing element 2 of the list l1\nl1[2]\n\n\n\n\n$my_vector\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n\n\nWe can obtain multiple elements\n\n# obtain a list containing elements 2 to 4 of the l1\nl1[2:4]\n\n\n\n\n$my_vector\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n$my_matrix\n     [,1] [,2] [,3]\n[1,]   NA   NA   NA\n[2,]   NA   NA   NA\n[3,]   NA   NA   NA\n\n$my_list\n$my_list$a\n[1] \"happy\" \"hippo\"\n\n$my_list$b\n[1] 42\n\n\n\nWe can exclude some elements using the - operator.\n\n# obtain a list containing all elements of l1 except for the 3rd\nl1[-3]\n\n\n\n\n$my_value\n[1] \"hello\"\n\n$my_vector\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n$my_list\n$my_list$a\n[1] \"happy\" \"hippo\"\n\n$my_list$b\n[1] 42\n\n\n\nLet us now turn to the case where we ant to obtain a specific element of a list. As mentioned above, we will use double brackets to do that. Note that we can only obtain a single element of a list in that fashion. If we try to specify multiple elements in double brackets, R will complain by returning an error message.\n\n# obtain element 2 of the list l1\nl1[[2]]\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1 1 2 3 5 8\n\n\n\nSome elements of our list are indexable elements on their own. When we obtain such an element using double brackets, we can use hierarchical indexing. That is, we can tell R to obtain parts of a part of a list. We can do that by first indexing the element of the list we want to obtain using double brackets and then specifying which element of the obtained element we want R to extract using either single brackets or double brackets depending on whether the desired element is another list or not.\nHere is some example code, in which we extract the first three elements of the second element of our list.\n\n# obtain elements 1 to 3 of the second element of l1\nl1[[2]][1:3]\n\n\n\n\n[1] 1 1 2\n\n\n\nAs a final example (just because we can), lets obtain the second element of the character vector that forms the first element of my_list, which is the last element of l1. In those cases, we need to think backwards (similar to calling multiple functions in one go), that is, we tell R to obtain the fourth element of l1, then to obtain that elements’ first element, and then to obtain that elements’ second element. The code to do so looks as follows:\n\n# obtain the second element of the 1st element of\n# the 4th element of the list l1\nl1[[4]][[1]][2]\n\n\n\n\n[1] \"hippo\"\n\n\n\n\nImportant: Given that indexing of lists is somewhat tricky, you might be wondering why we should bother with it. The answer is that many of the functions we will be using to analyse our data will return lists as their output. These lists can contain tons of information, and we may often require only some of it. Therefore, knowing how to access parts of a list can be extremely handy."

    "text": "Saving and overwriting indexed elements\nSo far, we have only used numerical indexing to make R show us the elements in the console. However, we can do two more things with the obtained elements:\n\nwe can use them as the definition of a new R object\nwe can overwrite them by defining new values for them\n\nIn other words, we can use them as both the left-hand-side and the right-hand-side argument in object definition.\n\nSaving elements of an object as a new object\nLet’s first look at the case in which we want to save parts of an object as an object of its own. For example, we might be interested in creating a reduced data frame, that contains only some of the variables of the original data frame. We will use the data frame defined above in this example.\n\n# create a reduced data frame that omits the \n# employment variable (4th column)\nreduced_df = my_df[, -4]\n\nRunning the code above will create a new object called reduced_df in the Environment. As we can see, it consists of 6 observations of 3 variables as compared to the original data frames 6 observations of 4 variables (which makes perfect sense since we asked R to remove one variable.\n\n\n\nFig 1. Defining part of a data frame as a new object\n\n\nHere is what the new data frame looks like in the console:\n\n\n\n  ID age gender\n1  1  40      m\n2  2  51      f\n3  3  32     nb\n4  4  23      f\n5  5  55      f\n6  6  68      m\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwriting elements of an object\nLet’s now have a look at the second case, in which we use part of an R object as the left-hand-side argument of object definition. As mentioned above, this corresponds to overwriting the existing values of those elements with new values. If we want to overwrite elements of an object, we must consider two rules:\nFirst, the new values must conform with the type of the object. We should overwrite numeric value only with numeric value, character strings with only with other character strings, and so on. If we overwrite existing values with values of different types, R will not return an error message. Instead, it will coerce the object such that all elements are of equal type. For example, trying to overwrite elements of a numeric or Boolean object with a character string will turn the whole object into a character string. If we overwrite an element of a numeric vector with a Boolean value (TRUE or FALSE), the object will remain numeric, and the new values will be interpreted as either 1 or 0, and so on.\n\nIn case of a data frame, each column works as its own object, that is, messing up one variable in this way will usually not mess up the other variables.\nHowever, if we overwrite a complete row of the data frame, we can potentially mess up the whole data frame, because now we tamper with elements of each column.\n\nSecond, we need to tell R the correct number of new values for the elements we want to overwrite. For example, if we want to overwrite two elements of a vector, we need to define the new values in a vector of length two, and if we want to overwrite the elements of a \\(3\\times2\\) matrix, the new values must be defined either in a \\(3\\times2\\) matrix or as a vector of length 6 (in the latter case, R will simply overwrite the old values with the values contained in the vector by filling columns from top to bottom and then moving to the next column). There is an exception to the second rule: we can always specify a single value as the new value. In this case, R will overwrite all of the old values with this new value.\nLet’s look at a few examples using the original data frame we defined above.\n\n# The first participant entered the wrong age; we need to overwrite it with the correct value\nmy_df$age[1] = 41\n\n# We want to capitalise the letters in our gender variable; overwrite the 3rd column (option A)\nmy_df[,3] = c('M', 'F', 'NB', 'F', 'F', 'M')\n\n# overwrite the 3rd column (option B)\nmy_df$gender = c('M', 'F', 'NB', 'F', 'F', 'M')\n\n# Participant 6 wants to retract their data we need to overwrite the 6th row with NAs\nmy_df[6,] = NA\n\nHere is what the data frame looks like after we have redefined the values as per the code above:\n\n\n\n  ID age gender employment\n1  1  41      M       TRUE\n2  2  51      F       TRUE\n3  3  32     NB       TRUE\n4  4  23      F       TRUE\n5  5  55      F       TRUE\n6 NA  NA   <NA>         NA\n\n\n\n\nNote that R has a slightly different way of showing that a value is NA (not available, i.e., missing) in the console whenever the object type is a character string. Rather than simply showing NA as it does when objects are numeric or Boolean, R will instead show  for character strings. This is purely cosmetic, that is, it has no consequences for the way we write code or how R evaluates it.\nIf we inspect the object using RStudio’s viewer, instead, all NA values will be shown as NA irrespective of their type.\n\n\n\nUsing numerical indexing to overwrite variable names\nRemember the names function we used previously to assign new names to the variables in a data fame? This function allows us to obtain the current variable names of a data frame. If we call it and feed it the name of a data frame as its function argument, R will return of character vector containing the names of all column contained in the data frame.\nThe names function also allows us to overwrite the existing variables names if we redefine the object returned by the function call as a character vector of equal length (i.e., one element per column of the data frame). Back then we noticed that using the name function might become tedious if a data frame contained a lot of variables. However, by using numerical indexing, we can circumvent the need to explicitly rename each variable in a data frame.\nSince the name function returns a character vector, we can use numerical indexing to pinpoint the variable names we are interested in. For example, we could ask R to tell us the name of the 2nd variable of a data frame or to overwrite the name of the 4th variable. Here is what the code would look like (we will be using the data frame we worked with above):\n\n# obtain the name of the data frame's 2nd variable\nnames(my_df)[2]\n\n# assign a new name to the 4th variable ('employed' instead of 'employment')\nnames(my_df)[4] = 'employed'\n\nRunning the code above prompts R to return the name of the data frame’s 2nd variable in the console:\n\n\n\n[1] \"age\"\n\n\n\nThis is what the data frame looks like after renaming the 4th column.\n\n\n\n  ID age gender employed\n1  1  41      M     TRUE\n2  2  51      F     TRUE\n3  3  32     NB     TRUE\n4  4  23      F     TRUE\n5  5  55      F     TRUE\n6 NA  NA   <NA>       NA\n\n\n\n\nTechnically, we must place the brackets used for indexing directly after the closing parentheses of the function call. Placing the brackets inside the parentheses instead resulted in error messages in previous versions of R. However, in the more recent versions of R, placing the brackets behind the name of the data frame inside the parentheses of the function call will also work. in other words, the two following lines of code produce identical results:\n\n# obtain the names of the first three variables\nnames(my_df)[1:3]\n\n# alternative code that yields the same result\nnames(my_df[1:3])"

We also know how to obtain a named element of a data frame or list, namely by using the $ operator. We will now turn to logical indexing, that is obtaining elements of objects that satisfy certain conditions.\nJust as with numerical indexing, logical indexing uses brackets. Within these brackets we can specify conditions that be be tested logically such that the result of the test is a TRUE or FALSE statement (i.e., a Boolean variable). R will then only show those elements of the object for which these conditions are true."

    "section": "Logical indexing using binary operators",
    "text": "Logical indexing using binary operators\nThe simplest form of logical indexing is to use a single statement involving a logical binary operator. For example, we could ask R to return to us all elements of a numeric vector (including, for example, a column of a data frame) that are greater then 3, or we could ask it to obtain all elements from a Boolean matrix that are TRUE.\nHere are a few examples:\n\n# create a numeric vector\nv1 = 1:6\n\n# create a Boolean 2x3 matrix\nm1 = matrix(\n  c(T, T, F, T, F, F),\n  nrow = 2\n)\n\n# obtain all elements of v1 that are greater than 3\nv1[v1 > 3]\n\n# obtain all elements of m1 that are TRUE\nm1[m1 == T]\n\nHere is what the output in the console looks like:\n\n\n\n[1] 4 5 6\n\n\n[1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n\n\nWe can also obtain elements by combining multiple logical statements using R’s AND and OR operators (& and |, respectively). For example, we could obtain all elements of the numeric vector we created above that exceed 2 AND are smaller than 5.\nIf we combine multiple logical tests in logical indexing, it is important that we tell R in each of the involved tests which variable to test. The following code would not work even though it may seem clear to us what it should mean:\n\n# obtain all elements of v1 that are greater than 2 and smaller than 5\nv1[v1 > 2 & < 5]\n\nWhile it looks as if we asked R to show us all elements that are greater than 2 AND smaller than 5, R will not know which variable the second part of the test refers to and will return an error message (in this message, R will tell us that the < sign following the & operator was unexpected).\nHere is how the code needs to look like if we want to obtain elements of an obect using a combination of multiple logical statements:\n\n# obtain all elements of v1 that are greater than 2 and smaller than 5\nv1[v1 > 2 & v1 < 5]\n\nThis code works as intended, which we can verify by looking at the output in the console.\n\n\n\n[1] 3 4\n\n\n\nOne neat thing about logical indexing is that we are not restricted to referring to the variable we want obtain elements from. As long as the outcome of the logical tests is an object of the same size as the object we want to obtain elements from, the ode will work.\nWhat this means is that we can obtain all elements of an object that satisfy conditions in other equally sized objects. This is particularly useful when we want to obtain elements of a data frame. For example, we might want R to show us all elements of one variable that satisfy the condition that another variable equal a specific value. Let’s look at a few specific examples.\n\n# create a data frame containing some demographic variables and responses to three 5-point Likert-scale items\nmy_df = data.frame(\n  ID = 1:6,\n  age = c(23, 21, 18, 16, 19, 17),\n  gender = c('f', 'f', 'm', 'm', 'f', 'f'),\n  item1 = c(2, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3),\n  item2 = c(1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1),\n  item3 = c(3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 2)\n)\n\n# obtain the responses to item 2 of all participants who are adults\nmy_df$item2[my_df$age >= 18]\n\n# obtain the gender of all participants who below 4 on items 1 and 3\nmy_df$gender[my_df$item1 < 4 & my_df$item3 < 4]\n\nHere is what the output in the console looks like:\n\n\n[1] 1 2 1 2\n\n\n[1] \"f\" \"f\"\n\n\nJust as with numerical indexing, we can also use logical indexing to save the obtained elements as a new object of their own, or we can overwrite the obtained elements. Let’s focus on overwriting. Overwriting of values using logical indexing is particularly useful in situations, in which missing data is coded using specific numbers (e.g., -99).\nNumeric values for missing data can cause problems if we do not detect it such as distorting some measures of central tendency (e.g., the mean) or variability (e.g., standard deviation, range). Ideally, we want missing data to be represented by NA when working with R. That means that we may end up having to replace certain values that code missing data with NAs manually. Logical indexing makes this a walk in the park as the following example shows.\n\n# add two more items to the data frame created above, both of which contain missing data coded as -99\nmy_df$item4 = c(3, 5, 3, -99, 4, -99)\nmy_df$item5 = c(-99, 2, 3, 1, -99, 2)\n\n# turn all elements that are equal to -99 into NAs\n# variant A:\nmy_df$item4[my_df$item4 == -99] = NA\nmy_df$item5[my_df$item5 == -99] = NA\n\n# variant B:\nmy_df[my_df == -99] = NA\n\nBoth ways of overwriting the -99s with NAs work. The second one is more parsimonious. However, replacing all elements of a certain value in a data frame can become messy in large data sets. If the code for missing data has been chosen poorly (e.g., 99), there may be some variables for which 999 is an actual and valid value (e.g., a reaction time in milliseconds). Therefore, caution is advised when replacing values for a complete data frame."

    "text": "Logical indexing using functions\nInstead of - or in addition to - binary operators, we can also use functions for logical indexing. We can use functions in two ways here. First, we can use the output of a function call as a value of comparison. For example, rather than testing whether an element of an object exceeds a certain fixed value, we could test whether it exceeds the mean or the median of that object.\nSecond, there a several functions that conduct logical tests. For example, the function is.na tests whether an object is NA, the function is.numeric tests whether an object’s type is numeric (either integer or double), and the function is.finite tests whether a numeric variable has a finite value.\n\nNote: R has a neat way of reversing functions such as is.na, is.numeric, and is.finite. We can make R test the respective opposite by preceding the function call with an exclamation mark (similar to how the operator != mean not equal).\nFor example, calling !is.na tests whether an object is not missing, !is.numeric tests whether the object’s type is different from numeric, and !is.finite tests whether a numeric value is infinite (or Inf in R terms).\n\nLet’s look at a few examples of logical indexing using functions. We will do so with the data frame we created and modified above. Here is a quick update on how the data frame looks currently.\n\n\n\n  ID age gender item1 item2 item3 item4 item5\n1  1  23      f     2     1     3     3    NA\n2  2  21      f     5     2     4     5     2\n3  3  18      m     5     1     5     3     3\n4  4  16      m     4     3     5    NA     1\n5  5  19      f     5     2     4     4    NA\n6  6  17      f     3     1     2    NA     2\n\n\n\nWe will now obtain and overwrite some of the elements of this data frame using the is.na function and its inverse, !is.na. Note that the complete function call including the opening and closing parentheses must be contained within the brackets.\n\n# obtain the age of all participants whose responded to item4\nmy_df$age[!is.na(my_df$item4)]\n\n# replace missing responses to items 4 with the average response (i.e., the mean of valid responses to that item across participants) \nmy_df$item5[is.na(my_df$item5)] = mean(my_df$item5, na.rm = T)\n\nRunning the first line of code above, yields the following output in the console:\n\n\n\n[1] 23 21 18 19\n\n\n\nAnd here is what the data frame looks like after we replaced the missing responses with the average response.\n\n\n\n  ID age gender item1 item2 item3 item4 item5\n1  1  23      f     2     1     3  3.00     2\n2  2  21      f     5     2     4  5.00     2\n3  3  18      m     5     1     5  3.00     3\n4  4  16      m     4     3     5  3.75     1\n5  5  19      f     5     2     4  4.00     2\n6  6  17      f     3     1     2  3.75     2\n\n\n\n\nNote how R now displays two decimals for item4. It does not display decimals for the other items, even though their object type is double - just as that of item4 (we can find out the object types by calling the function typeof and feeding it the column of interest as the sole function argument).\nR generally only uses as many decimals as it has to. If a double type object contains only whole numbers, then R will simply omit the decimals."

    "text": "Writing R functions is easy, once we understand how R functions work (and we do know that from looking at the documentation of different functions). What we need to do when defining a custom function is to: - give it a name (ideally a unique name to avoid conflicts with existing functions) - tell R what function arguments the function should have - tell R whether any of the arguments should have default values - tell R what operations it should perform when we call the function\nWhen defining the function, we need to use a specific Syntax. Just as with R objects, we write the name of our custom function to the left of an equal sign. To its right we call the function function. This function does not have fixed arguments that we specifiy in parentheses. Instead, we write those arguments in parentheses that we want our our custom function to have. If we would like there to be a default value for a function argument, we can use an equal sign following the argument name and enter the respective value to its right.\nFinally, we use braces to define what the function should do, that is, which operations to run on the arguments we fed it. Here, sky is the limit to our creativity. We can use any binary operator or function (even other custom functions) to tell R what it it should do. The final line of code within the braces should be a call of the function return, which we can use to define the output of our custom function. Let’s look at a few examples.\n\nExample 1\nIn the first example, we will write a custom function that computed the uncorrected standard deviation of a numeric vector (remember that the function sd that is built into base R computed the bias-corrected standard deviation, which may not always be what we are looking for). We will call this function sd_uncorrected (any name is fine, but it may be prudent to choose a name that is informative of what the function does).\nThe R code for defining this function could look as follows:\n\nsd_uncorrected = function(x, na.rm = TRUE){\n  \n  x = na.omit(x)  # excludes elements of x that are NA (if any)\n  n = length(x)   # sample size n is the length of the vector x\n  \n  var_x = 1/n * sum((x - mean(x))^2)  # compute uncorrected variance of x\n  sd = sqrt(var_x)                    # take square root to get sd\n  \n  return(sd)                          # return the object sd, which happens to be\n                                      # a single numeric value\n  \n}"
