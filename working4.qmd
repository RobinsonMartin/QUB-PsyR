title: "Logical Indexing"

So far, we have learned how to obtain parts of an R object using numeric indexing. We also know how to obtain a names element of a data frame or list, namely by using the **$** operator. We will now turn to logical indexing, that is obtaining elements of objects that satisfy certain conditions. 

Just as with numerical indexing, logical indexing uses brackets. Within these brackets we can specify conditions that be be tested logically such that the result of the test is a TRUE or FALSE statement (i.e., a Boolean variable). R will then only show those elements of the object for which these conditions are true.


## Logical indexing using binary operators

The simplest form of logical indexing is to use a single statement involving a logical binary operator. For example, we could ask R to return to us all element of a numeric vector that are greater then 5, or we could ask it to obtain all elements from a Boolean matrix that are TRUE.
